## Features

- **One-on-one family chats** with real-time messaging
- **Daily conversation prompts** generated by AI to spark meaningful discussions
- **Relationship context** - prompts adapt based on family member relationships
- **Real-time sync** across devices using Firebase

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- Firebase Firestore (real-time database)
- OpenAI API (conversation prompts)
- ESLint + Prettier

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/familink.ai.git
   cd familink.ai
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Add your Firebase config and optionally an OpenAI API key to `.env`

3. **Run**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Configuration

### Firebase (Required)
1. Create a project at [firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Add your config to `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   # ... other Firebase config
   ```

### OpenAI (Optional)
Add to `.env` for AI-generated prompts:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```
Without this, the app uses default conversation starters.

## Scripts
